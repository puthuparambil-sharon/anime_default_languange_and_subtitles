MKV Anime Batch Reorder & Flagged

A Python-based automation tool that uses MKVToolNix to batch-process MKV files. It specifically targets anime libraries to ensure that Japanese Audio and Full English Subtitles are physically reordered to the top of the file and set as the default/forced tracks.

🚀 Features
Physical Reordering: Moves Japanese audio and English subtitles to the first positions (Track 1) for maximum player compatibility.

Smart Subtitle Detection: Prioritizes "Full" English subtitles and intelligently skips "Signs & Songs" tracks.

Recursive Processing: Automatically scans all subfolders in your library.

Multi-threaded: Uses Python's ThreadPoolExecutor to process multiple files simultaneously for faster completion on SSDs.

Non-Destructive: Reads from an Original folder and writes to a Modified folder, keeping your source files safe.

🛠 Prerequisites
You must have MKVToolNix installed and added to your system's PATH.

macOS: brew install mkvtoolnix

Windows: Install via the official MKVToolNix downloads.
